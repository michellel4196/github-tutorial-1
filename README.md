## Git vs. GitHub
* Git is a version control system that keep snapshots (earlier versions) of code 
  * Runs in the command line
* Github stores code in the cloud (the internet) 
  * You can visually track your changes on Git
  * Makes collaborating on files easier

###### **_Git does not require Github but Github requires Git_**

## Initial Setup
You will be doing all of your work on the websites github and cloud9
#### To make a github account . . .
* Go to https://github.com/ (the github website)
* Click Sign up at the upper righthand side of the screen and fill in the information (Username, email address, and password )
* When you finish filling out this information in Step 1, click "Create an account" at the bottom of the screen and move on to Step 2
* Select the the free mode then click "Continue" to go to Step 3
  * The two boxes between these are optional. Read and select for your own liking
* Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "skip this step" 
 * Go to the email that you paired the accout with and open the conformation email and click the link in the email
 
#### **You now have a Github account**


#### To create you cloud9 account . . .  
* Go to https://c9.io/login (the cloud9 website) and click the cat icon at the upper righthand side of the screen
* Login using you Github account and click "Sign in"
* Click "Authorize c9"
* Click "Sign in to Cloud9"
* Click the gear icon on the top-right of the screen then click "Connected Services"
* Connect Github by clicking "connect" on the Github section

#### To create a workspace . . .
* On the Cloud9 homepage, click " + Create a new workspace"
* Name the workspace "github-learning"
* Type "Version Control and Collaboration" as the description
* Select "Don't set a team for this workspace" in the Team section
* Select "Blank" as the template and click "Create Workspace"

After you have completed this, it is time to create an SSH key between Github and Cloud9

##### In your Github account . . .
* Click your profile icon at the top-right corner of the screen and click settings
* On the lefts sidebar, click "SSH and GPG"

  * Go to "SSH keys tab" and copy and paste the second SSH key into the Key section (starts with **ssh-rsa**)
  * Click "Add SSH key"
* Open your new workspace and type in `ssh -T git@github.com` to the command line (It should say after "Hi <your username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access")

## Repository Setup
Now that you have all your accounts set up, it is time to make your first repository on cloud9, repo for short. but before you do this , we will create a remote. A remote is a repository that is not on cloud9 and acts as a backup to your local repo (cloud9 in this scenario). You will be able to send your changes to your remote repo and will appear on your github account.
##### To create a remote repo . . .
* Go to your github account and on the top-right, click the "+" sign and click "New repository"
* Name it the **exact same name** as your repo on cloud9, or else it will not work
* Click "Create repository"
* If you were asked to verify your email, do it. If it did not, continue to the next steps
* Click "SSH" and where it says "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line", copy and paste the lines under it into the command line one by one
* 
#### To make your first repo, type in the following to the command line (one at a time)
* `cd ~/workspace`
* `mkdir first-repo` (makes a new folder calles "first-repo")
* `cd first-repo` (Goes into the new folder)
* `git init` (this makes the folder a repository)
##### You now have your first repo!
##### To add your first README file, type into the command line . . .
* `touch README.md`
* `c9 README.md` (opens the README file)
  * Type in anything you want in the opened file (Ex: "This is my first repo")
* `cd add README.md` (adds the new changes to the staging area to me commited)
* What would be a good commit message?
* `git commit -m "create readme"` (Makes a snapshot of the current code)
  * In the quotation mark, write a message in the present-tense that relates to the changes you made. Ex: "Type my first line on README.md")
##### You have now made your first commit!
